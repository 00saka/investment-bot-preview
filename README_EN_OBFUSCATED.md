# Investment Bot (Public Preview Version)

This program is a simplified and obfuscated version of a personal investment bot that analyzes market data and provides buy or sell recommendations. It does not perform any real trading but sends suggestions via Telegram.

## Features
- Downloads real-time stock data via an API  
- Analyzes data using internal calculation principles  
- Provides buy or sell signals based on selected stocks or ETFs  
- Sends recommendations via Telegram messages  
- Remembers purchase prices of owned assets and uses them in analysis  
- Uses a local SQLite database to store personal investment data (such as purchase prices), supporting analysis features  

⚠️ This version does not include the full algorithmic logic or formulas.

## Language and Localization
The source code and user-facing interface (such as messages, prompts, and outputs) are primarily in Finnish, as the project was originally created for personal use. Documentation is provided in English.

## Privacy and Security
No API keys or credentials are included. The full version uses an encrypted external key file, which is not publicly shared.

## Notes
- This version is intended solely to demonstrate programming capabilities.  
- It does not contain all original features or logic.  
- Recommendations are not investment advice.
